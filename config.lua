-- hi!
-- if youre reading this, that means you want to toggle the copyrighted music.
-- because I can't code for shit, a working config page will have to wait until a full release.
-- (or i can just steal it from cryptid idk)
-- so for now, just set whatever  songs you want to either true or false.
-- Drops config doesnt work right so just put it in the ae area
return {
		["Drop"] = false,
		
		["getr"] = true,
		["ae"] = {
			["vigilante"] = true,
		},
	
}
